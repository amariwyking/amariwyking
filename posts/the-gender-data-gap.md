Picture a world where every product, service, and system was designed with only half of humanity in mind. Now consider this: despite the sex ratio of the global population maintaining a near-even split of 101 males to 100 females (2020 est.), this hypothetical scenario reflects our current reality more closely than we might care to admit. Over thousands of years, male and female bodies have evolved to aid in the fulfillment of tasks integral to our survival in ways both respective and irrespective of sex. As humans' ability to manipulate the world around us continues to advance, one might expect that we would follow in nature's footsteps and service our needs with respect to sex. However, evidence suggests otherwise.

"Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men" by Caroline Criado Perez examines this shortcoming and supports the claim that human society, on a global scale, is failing to equitably address the needs of women. This critical topic of discussion should garner attention from designers and decision-makers across all fields in which the end user is an individual. Throughout the book, the author demonstrates how gender-biased design has pervaded every aspect of society through myriad examples of products, services, and designs that preference the experience of men at the disservice of women.

Perhaps the most thought-provoking example I've encountered thus far was the provision of snow-clearing services in Karlskoga, Sweden. On the surface, snow clearing might seem like a public service far removed from gender bias, but Perez demonstrates why sex matters. Under the original program, Karlskoga's snow-clearing services were primarily dedicated to major traffic arteries. However, data shows that across the world, women are more likely than men to walk and take public transportation. This means that women using pedestrian walkways during winter were disproportionately exposed to hazards associated with walking on snowy or icy surfaces. While this might sound theoretical, data from France, Philadelphia, and Chicago shows that women contribute to more than 60% of ridership. Meanwhile, in Umeå, a study found that "79% of pedestrian injuries occurred during winter months, and women made up 69% of those who had been injured in single-person incidents," exposing the tangible health impacts of neglecting to consider women's needs when provisioning city services. This example, among others presented, has changed the way I look at urban design and has inspired me to actively question whether the city services that I benefit from are equitably serving women's needs.

Unsurprisingly, the Karlskoga case is not the only example of women's health being disproportionately affected by negligent design. Despite the many data gaps that exist in sex-disaggregated data, women invariably do the most cooking. Across the Global South, rural communities still depend on biomass fuels as the primary source of energy used for cooking. Consequently, women are disproportionately affected by the negative health implications that come with cooking on a traditional stove, as they are exposed to toxic fumes for hours while cooking. For decades, the Indian government made significant efforts to introduce clean stoves to rural communities through the provision of high-efficiency cookstoves. However, these efforts had very limited success until 2015, when researchers provided another alternative: an inexpensive device that improved exhaust fumes and increased fuel efficiency while allowing users to adapt the solution to their existing stove apparatus. Only after successful adoption of this device did the researchers find themselves speaking to women in an effort to learn *why* the solution was accepted. They had approached the problem backwards; the more effective approach would have been to speak to women, the primary stakeholders in the device's use, from the beginning. This serves as an important lesson that can be abstracted and applied to all forms of product design.

The examples from Perez's work illuminate a sobering truth: the absence of sex-disaggregated data in design processes isn't merely an oversight—it's a systematic failure that perpetuates gender inequity across societies. As I continue reading her book, each new example reinforces the urgency of addressing these disparities. For designers and decision-makers, the path forward requires more than just awareness; it demands a fundamental shift in how we approach problem-solving. We must move beyond the assumption that design can be gender-neutral and instead actively seek out and incorporate women's perspectives from the outset. Only then can we begin to create a world that truly serves all of humanity, not just half of it. As I progress in my own career, these insights will serve as a constant reminder that the most effective solutions emerge not from our assumptions, but from our willingness to question them.
