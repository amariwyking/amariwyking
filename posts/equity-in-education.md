## Bridging Funding Disparities for a Prosperous America

### Key Insights
>
> The United States' use of property taxbased school funding leads to unequal access to essential resources like infrastructure, technology, and support staff, adversely affecting student success, particularly in economically challenged areas.

>
> Communities of color bear a disproportionate burden of these funding inequities, with districts serving more students of color receiving significantly less funding per student than their counterparts.

>
> Federal legislation is crucial to address these disparities and promote equitable public education. It should prioritize funding reform, resource equity, and closing educational gaps, aligning with principles of fairness and justice to ensure a more equitable future.

### What's the issue?

Quality education serves as the bedrock of prosperous and equitable communities, fostering the capacity to address local, national, and global challenges effectively. However, a persistent issue undermining educational equity in the United States is the reliance on property tax-based school funding. As data from (Baines 2022) reveals, this system has led to substantial disparities in educational resources and opportunities as the probability of finding a high-performing public school is directly proportional to the wealth of the neighborhood.

One of the key consequences of property tax-based funding is evident in the disparities in unrestricted funds available to schools. Since, public schools in communities with limited resources generate lower revenue from local property taxes (the primary local education funding source), they depend on state and limited local funding to address operational and capital infrastructure expenses necessary for improving school facilities (Modaffari 2022). This results in school infrastructure deteriorating, up-to-date technology becoming inaccessible, reduced availability of support staff, and ultimately, lower student achievement (Baines 2022). Additionally, schools in affluent areas often benefit from well-supported art programs and field trips, important components of a well-rounded academic experience, while those in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods struggle to provide even the most basic resources.

These funding inequities disproportionately affect students in communities primarily composed of people of color, where historical underinvestment has perpetuated a cycle of educational debt. In 2018, The Education Trust found that "nationally, districts serving the most students of color receive about $1,800, or 13 percent, less per student than districts serving the fewest students of color". This educational debt contributes to lower academic achievement, thus exacerbating the disparities in opportunities and inhibiting students' abilities to contribute to their communities and our society.

### Why is this important for America?

The glaring disparities in local education funding within the United States represent a pressing concern that jeopardizes the nation's commitment to providing equitable opportunities for all students. These disparities, deeply rooted in the dependence on local property taxes as the primary source of education funding, cast a shadow over the pledge of equitable education.

Much like the landmark "Brown v. Board of Education" case in 1954 highlighted the injustice of segregated schools, the current funding disparities symbolize fiscal inequality. Although the intention behind local funding control was to empower communities, it has inadvertently spawned a system where students' educational prospects hinge on their geographic location and the affluence of their neighborhoods.

The consequences are stark. Affluent schools enjoy ample resources, offering smaller class sizes, cutting-edge technology, and a wide array of educational opportunities. In contrast, schools in impoverished areas grapple with overcrowded classrooms, antiquated resources, and limited support staff.

These disparities hinder equitable access to knowledge and opportunity, perpetuating cycles of inequality. To fulfill the promise of U.S. public education and ensure equitable opportunities, federal legislation is imperative. It should target funding reform, prioritize resource equity, and bridge educational gaps.

By addressing funding disparities, the government can uphold the principles of fairness and justice and provide every American child with an equal opportunity to thrive. Upholding this promise not only aligns with the spirit of "Brown v. Board of Education" but also charts a path toward a more equitable and prosperous future for all Americans.

### What should policy makers on?

> Local policymakers should work towards revising the property tax-based funding system to reduce disparities in educational resources among communities. This could involve developing more equitable funding formulas that take into account the specific needs of schools and districts, especially those serving economically disadvantaged populations.

> Federal government intervention is essential to address funding disparities effectively. Policymakers should consider implementing federal legislation that provides additional funding to schools in underprivileged areas, ensuring that all students have access to quality education, regardless of their geographic location or neighborhood wealth.

> Policymakers should establish processes for increased accountability and transparency in how education funds are allocated and spent. This may include regular audits, reporting standards, and data-driven assessments to ensure that funding is reaching the students who need it most and making a meaningful impact on their educational outcomes.
