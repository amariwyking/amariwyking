description: After spending 15 weeks learning about the ideas and techniques associated with design thinking and more importantly, putting them into practice, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on some emergent concepts that stood out to me.

The process we now call “design thinking” began developing in the 1970s. Its value has proven so significant that New York University now offers it as a course, where I had the privilege of learning its principles under Kristine Mudd’s instruction. After 15 weeks of studying and practicing design thinking techniques, I want to reflect on what stood out to me most.
## Do as nature does
Nature is a marvel. Natural cycles and ecosystems throughout nature work in concert, pushing here and pulling there in a struggle for equilibrium. During moments of admiration, the feeling that nature is perfect often bubbles up. Yet a closer look reveals that nature is far from perfect. Instead, nature embraces failure, with forces of life and death catalyzing adaptation. This creates a masterclass in iterative design, a key pillar of design thinking.
When developing solutions for a problem space, we must accept that ideas rarely arrive fully formed. Whatever emerges during ideation will need iteration and refinement until it becomes worthy of appraisal, just as nature’s creations adapt to their problem sets.
## At the root of the problem…is another problem
The iterative process extends beyond developing solutions — it must begin with the problem itself. In my group’s term project, we chose university student sleep as our problem space. What began as an initiative to improve student sleep habits evolved into an application for maximizing daytime productivity. This shift emerged from our field research, where we interviewed NYU students and explored sleep patterns in depth. These interviews revealed personal experiences, behaviors, and grievances, which we noted and compiled. Organizing these notes on a synthesis board allowed themes to surface naturally.
We discovered that students across demographics felt stressed from academic pressures, often sacrificing sleep for schoolwork.
## Shift your perspective
Once we were confident in our identification of a problem worth solving, we put our pride aside and engaged in another round of iteration, this time through problem reframing. Ultimately, this led us to design a solution helping students dedicate time to studies while reducing the effort needed for scheduling and executing tasks.
Key steps in this process included:
- **Articulating the problem and identifying who’s involved:** Should our solution target students or course instructors?
- **Consider what we might be missing:** Perhaps students are misusing time during the day
- **Rethinking whether this is the proper goal to pursue:** Are students looking for solutions to be more productive?
- **Examining bright spots:** Some students do manage to handle homework and sleep well
- **Considering how we might be contributing to the problem:** Will our push notifications contribute to student stress?

The process of reframing problems and letting solutions evolve through iteration has fundamentally changed how I approach challenges. My experience with my team and Kristine’s course showed me that what seems like an obvious solution rarely survives first contact with reality — you’ve got to get your hands dirty, talk to real people, and challenge your assumptions. As I move into entrepreneurship, I plan to embrace this spirit of constant evolution. Like the ecosystems I discussed earlier, I’ll let my ideas push and pull, die and adapt, until they find their place in the market’s delicate balance.
