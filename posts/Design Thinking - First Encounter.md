description: After spending 15 weeks learning about the ideas and techniques associated with design thinking and more importantly, putting them into practice, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on some emergent concepts that stood out to me.

The idea for this last reflection is to put in context the readings, class activities and team project and highlight the key learnings forÂ _you._

- Illustrate your ideas and insights with a couple of specific examples.
- Include some thoughts about how this connects to your studies or future (professional or personal) endeavors, and what methods/dimensions you might want to explore further.

**Brainstorm**

In engineering the traditional philosophy surrounding design goes something like this:

- Identify a problem
- Assemble a team of experts to study the problem
- Develop a solution, test it
- Push to market

In retrospect, one might shake their head at the fact that there seemed to be little regard for the opinion of anyone outside of the product's own team.

It wasn't until the 1970s that the process we refer to today as "design thinking" began to develop. Since then, design thinking has proven to be so valuable that it is now offered as a course at New York University. It was here that I had the privilege of learning the ins and outs of design thinking under the instruction of Kristine Mudd. After spending 15 weeks learning about the ideas and techniques associated with design thinking and more importantly, putting them into practice, it's worth taking a moment to reflect on the things that stood out to me most.

### Be Like Nature

Nature is an absolute marvel. The myriad natural cycles and delicate ecosystems that exist throughout nature seem to work in perfect concert, pushing here and pulling there in a struggle for equilibrium. It's not rare that the feeling that nature is perfect might bubble up during a moment of admiration. But when one takes a closer look, it becomes apparent that nature is far from perfect. Rather, nature is constantly embracing failure, as the forces of life and death catalyze adaptation. The result is a masterclass in iterative design, a key pillar of design thinking.

It's vitally important for us to accept that when developing solutions for a problem space, ideas will seldom be fully developed upon arrival. Rather, we should expect that whatever is proposed during the ideation phase will be iterated upon and refined until an idea worthy of appraisal has emerged, just as nature's creations continue to adapt to their problem sets.

### At the root of the problem... is another problem

What stands out to me is that this iterative process should not be exclusive to the development of the solution. In fact, iteration should begin with the problem. For my groups term project, we designated university student sleep as our problem space. But what started out as an initiative to improve students sleep habits, ended as an application designed to help students maximize productivity during the day. This development was the result of our field research, which entailed us interviewing a diverse group of NYU students and diving deep into all things sleep. The interviews provided us with an array of personal experiences, behaviors, and grievances which we diligently noted and compiled. Using a synthesis board to organize these notes allowed for common themes to naturally emerge.

What we found was that students across all demographics expressed that they feel stressed due to academic pressures and many students made a habit of sacrificing sleep to complete schoolwork. Consequently, we set out to design a solution that could help students dedicate time to their studies while minimizing the effort that goes into scheduling and executing tasks. Of course...the development of our solution would be an iterative process as well.
