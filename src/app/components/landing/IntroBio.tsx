                I&apos;m a software engineer with a strong focus on data-driven systems and urban technology. My background spans full-stack development, mobile applications, and machine learning, shaped by industry experience at leading tech companies and graduate research at the NYU Center for Urban Science + Progress.
                <br />
                I bring a product-oriented mindset to technical challenges, with a particular interest in building scalable tools that improve how complex systems—especially cities—operate and adapt. Whether it be digital products or researching urban problems, I love digging into problems that sit at the edge of software, data, and the real world.
